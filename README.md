# lang
Project to learn concepts from *INF225 (Program Translation)* that will hopefully result in some fun programming language.

### The current grammar that I am trying to implement
```
<exp> ::= <exp> + <exp>
<exp> ::= <exp> * <exp>
<exp> ::= "(" <exp> ")">
<exp> ::= <num>
<num> ::= simple integers
```
